/// Currently the files a protected by making a copy of each file/directory
/// into a unique system temp directory and then moved back once the
/// [action] has completed.

///
/// [withFileProtection] is safe to use in a nested fashion as each call
/// to [withFileProtection] creates its own separate backup area.
///
/// If the VM aborts during execution of the [action] you will find
/// the backed up files in the system temp directory under a directory named
/// .withFileProtection'. You may need to use the time stamp to determine which
/// directory is the right one if you have had mulitple failures.
/// Under normal circumstances the temp directory is delete once the action
/// completes.
///
/// The [protected] list can contain files, directories.
///
/// If the entry is a directory then all children (files and directories)
/// are protected.
///
/// Entries in the [protected] list may be relative or absolute.
///
/// If [protected] contains a file or directory that doesn't exist
/// and the [action] subsequently creates those entities, then those files
/// and/or directories will be deleted after [action] completes.
///
/// This function can be useful for doing dry-run operations
/// where you need to ensure the filesystem is restore to its
/// prior state after the dry-run completes.
